lets also do more recon and find services version etc
in the mean time lets visit the web page
![[Pasted image 20250806203652.png]]
lets run a gobuster directory finder
while gobuster is running we got the result of sevice scan in nmap
![[Pasted image 20250806203758.png]]
checking if it is running any service with outdated version or vulnerabilty

by the time vulnerability sacn is finished i found somethin intresting directory in gobuster
![[Pasted image 20250806212549.png]]
gone ahead visited these and found the uploads,panel intresting
panel
![[Pasted image 20250806212758.png]]
upload
![[Pasted image 20250806212845.png]]
(these screenshots are taken after testing many things and expoiting)
in these we can upload files in the panel and view can view them in uploads
the hint from TryHackMe gives us a hint that it has something to do with PHP reverse shell and also we need to bypass file upload sanitation

i used this online reverse shell generator to generate reverse shell
after trying the php reverse shell one by one the 2nd php reverse shell of pentest mokeys worked
and running a netcat listener we get a reverse shell
but it ain't a root shell 
we need to get root privilage
there is a hint in the the room
![[Pasted image 20250806213741.png]]
well it just fetches the file that has SUID bit set 
![[Pasted image 20250806213940.png]]
we can see if something will give us privilage escalation through this page
https://gtfobins.github.io/
in this we see there is python
![[Pasted image 20250806214132.png]]
well i tried this but didn't work
then i asked chatgpt and he gave me this 
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
but this is not a root shell inside the shell generated by this i ran th one from the websit to get root shell 
```
./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```
